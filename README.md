👋 Hey, I’m Isaiah

Aspiring cybersecurity researcher & pentester with a deep curiosity for how systems really work. I love building tools, breaking assumptions, and understanding the internals of whatever I’m working on — from OS behavior to schema design to hardware quirks.

🔍 What I Do

Develop security tooling (currently building Hermes, a modular tool with plugin-based architecture)

Experiment with home lab setups and test environments

Break down complex systems to understand how pieces interact

Work on structured data models, correlators, and automation ideas

Constantly learning more about offensive security, system design, and low-level behavior

💡 What I’m Interested In

Pentesting & security research

Building modular, extensible tools

OS internals, boot processes, virtualization

Large-scale schema design & data correlation

Hardware tinkering and weird system behavior

🧠 How I Work

I’m project-driven, highly inquisitive, and not afraid to dive deep into the messy details. If something behaves unexpectedly—software or hardware—I want to know why. I love iterating on my projects, refining architecture, and experimenting until things feel right.

🔧 Current Project: Hermes (https://github.com/Expert21/hermes-osint)

A flexible, plugin-driven security tool with its own API, designed for extensibility and clean integration across multiple modules.


📈 Long-Term Goals

Become a skilled, well-rounded pentester

Build reliable open-source tools for security testing

Create systems that make complex analysis easier and more automated
